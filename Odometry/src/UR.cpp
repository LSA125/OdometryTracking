       Late night Delivery

in the darkness, upon this nightly hour,
it is $7.95 chicken teriyaki from Sushi Katsu that we desire.
The clock strikes seven, hungrily we wait,
for a sweet, chickeny, steamy plate.
Moist, sticky, white rice awaits its destiny
for it knows its place is best in me.
Our order reaches the noble driver Mohammed,
for we know our meal will be enchanted,
with sweet, sweet teriyaki sauce.
