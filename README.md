# Odometry Tracking

This is c++ code for Vex Coding Studios.
Key features:
* Pure Pursuit autonomous movement algorithm
Found in ```../chassis``` *follow path* and *get look ahead* functions.
* Odometry Tracking with 3 encoders
Found in ```../chassis``` *track postion* path functions.
* PID Control for all movement
* Exponential driving input
* Switch between mechanum and omni drive.
* Exponential drive for smoother controls
